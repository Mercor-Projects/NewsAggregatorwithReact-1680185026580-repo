### Welcome to the News Aggregator with React challenge! You will push your code here.

#### Description
**General Overview:**

In this project, you will create a news aggregator app that displays news from a variety of sources in a nice user interface. The app should allow users to browse news articles by category and source, and provide a search function for specific topics. The project must be built using React.js.



**Required Components:**

- User Interface: Create a user interface for the news aggregator app using React.js. The interface should include a navigation bar with categories and sources, a section for displaying news articles, and a search function for finding specific topics.
- API Integration: Use an API like News API to fetch news data from various sources. Use React state to manage the app's data, including the list of news articles and their details.
- Display News Articles: Display the news articles in the app, including their title, author, date, source, and content. Allow users to click on an article to view its full content.
- Categories and Sources: Allow users to filter news articles by category (e.g. business, sports, politics) and by source (e.g. CNN, BBC, Reuters).
- Error Handling: Handle errors that may occur while fetching news data, and display an error message to the user.
